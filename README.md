Text Editor Web Application
This is a comprehensive text editor web application that fulfills the following user story:

User Story
As a developer, I want to create and manage text notes or code snippets efficiently using a web-based text editor. Additionally, I want the application to provide seamless functionality and reliability across different scenarios, including offline usage and installation as a Progressive Web Application (PWA).

Features
Client-Server Folder Structure: Upon opening the application in your editor, you'll see a well-organized client-server folder structure.

Backend and Client Initialization: Running npm run start from the root directory initiates both the backend and serves the client, ensuring a smooth application startup.

Webpack Bundling: JavaScript files are bundled using webpack, providing efficient code organization and optimization.

Webpack Plugins: Running webpack plugins generates an HTML file, service worker, and manifest file, facilitating the application's functionality.

Next-Gen JavaScript Support: The application seamlessly supports next-gen JavaScript features, ensuring compatibility and enhanced performance without errors.

IndexedDB Integration: Upon opening the text editor, IndexedDB immediately creates a database storage, allowing seamless data storage and retrieval even when offline.

Automatic Content Saving: Content entered into the text editor is automatically saved with IndexedDB when the DOM window is unfocused, ensuring data persistence.

Content Retrieval: Reopening the text editor after closing it retrieves the previously saved content from IndexedDB, providing a seamless user experience.

Installation as PWA: Clicking on the Install button allows users to download the web application as an icon on their desktop, enabling installation as a Progressive Web Application (PWA) for convenient access.

Service Worker Registration: Upon loading the web application, a registered service worker using workbox ensures efficient caching of static assets, enabling offline usage and faster subsequent page loads.

Static Assets Pre-Caching: Service worker registration pre-caches static assets upon loading, ensuring optimal performance and reliability.

Deployment Ready: Proper build scripts for a webpack application ensure seamless deployment to Render or any other hosting platform.
